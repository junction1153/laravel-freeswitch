How To Create a SignalWire Personal Access Token
================================================

## Obtaining an Access Token

A SignalWire account is now required to download the pre-build FreeSWITCH binaries. First [create a SignalWire space](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides/signing-up-for-a-space), then go to the `Personal Access Tokens` section located on the left side of the dashboard. From there, create a Personal Access Token. [Click here to learn more](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Debian).

## Revoking an Access Token

To initiate the revocation of your Personal Access Token, please navigate to the `Personal Access Tokens` section within your SignalWire space. Within this section, you will be presented with a list of previously created tokens alongside the option to revoke them.
